Larissa by Shel Silverstein

Larissa loves me,
Larissa cares,
Larissa picks me peaches and pears.
Larissa offers me candy and Cokes,
Larissa listens and laughs at me jokes.
Larissa helps when I get in a fight,
Larissa does all my homework at night.
Larissa misses me,
Larissa cries,
Larissa thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Larissa is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Larissa just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Larissa's hand,
In the darkness where Larissa usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Larissa's gone!
